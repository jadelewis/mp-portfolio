            <h2 class="section-heading"> Accessibility:  </h2>
          <p>  I wanted to make my website inclusive and accessible for people to understand and use. So, I used alt-text to describe an image for visually impaired people and took in consideration of how-to layout my page and which fonts to use which would be the easiest to understand which was a sans safric font. Microsoft is a company who takes accessibility seriously and is a good company to inspire too while designing a website.</p>

          <p>“The interactions we

design with technology depend heavily

on what we can see, hear, say, and touch.

Assuming all those senses and abilities

are fully enabled all the time creates the

potential to ignore much of the range

of humanity” (Microsoft 2017)  </p>

          <p>The persona spectrum is used by Microsoft to understand and have empathy for different peoples struggles and to see if one design could help people with different difficulties, for example if a person has one arm, a person with a temporary injury or a parent holding a baby can also receive help from that design. The persona network also extends to family and friends of a person with a disability so it is important I could create a website that various people can use. Designing a website that is accessible for people creates more emotional content, reduced friction and increased access</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Colour Theory:  </h2>

          <p>   </p>

          <p>Whilst designing a website, colour was the one of the most important decisions- as my header picture is of red apples, I chose #72e829 green as my typography as it complements the red and both colours are associated with the fruit.  .</p>



          <p>The psychology of colour is how different colours and colour combinations give people different emotions and thoughts, the darker colour of the apples example can be associated with richness and indulgence while green is earthy and associated with nature which is the theme of my photography. Red is a primary colour and has a warm temperature and works well with a cool colour like green that is on the opposite end of the wheel chart so they contrast.  A hex code is a six-digit combination of letter and numbers that has a mix of red, green and blue (RGB). This is an example of a hex code #FFCC99, the first two digits (FF) are red, the next digits (CC) are blue and the last digits (99) are the green and the # is the hex code. The RGB is a colour model in which red, green and blue are mixed together to produce new colours.</p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Typography:</h2>



          <p></p>

            <p>  Typography is the appearance of written words and makes written language appealing and readable - choosing the style of typography is important as the font and size gives the reader an impression. Different fonts can be used as an expression for example the font Arial is quite formal while courier new is more casual. I looked through many fonts from Googlefonts and decided ‘Comfortaa’ was the right font for my website because it was sans serif and looks modern, casual and stands out in larger sizes. During this module I have learnt other typography aspects like the letterform which is the shape of the letter and takes in consideration of the baseline, cap height and cross bar, my font is sans serif and doesn’t have a line. Typefaces are the variation a font can have like bold, regular, light, italic. I used one font with two typefaces, I made my header text in bold other text in light comfortaa. The style of my font has  distinguishable letters so it is easy to read. </p>
