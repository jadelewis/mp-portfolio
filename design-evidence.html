          <p>Accessibility:  I wanted to make my website inclusive and accessible for people to understand and use. So, I used alt-text to describe an image for visually impaired people and took in consideration of how-to layout my page and which fonts to use which would be the easiest to understand which was a sans safric font. Microsoft is a company who takes accessibility seriously and is a good company to inspire too while designing a website.</p>

          <p>“The interactions we

design with technology depend heavily

on what we can see, hear, say, and touch.

Assuming all those senses and abilities

are fully enabled all the time creates the

potential to ignore much of the range

of humanity” (Microsoft 2017)  </p>

          <p>The persona spectrum is used by Microsoft to understand and have empathy for different peoples struggles and to see if one design could help people with different difficulties, for example if a person has one arm, a person with a temporary injury or a parent holding a baby can also receive help from that design. The persona network also extends to family and friends of a person with a disability so it is important I could create a website that various people can use. Designing a website that is accessible for people creates more emotional content, reduced friction and increased access</p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
