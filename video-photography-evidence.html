            <h2 class="section-heading">Photography basics:</h2>

          <p> I chose to take my photos on a DSL camera so I could have better control of the DOF and have a better image quality- and to also get experience taking photos on a camera instead of a mobile phone. During this module I have learnt how to use the aperture and shutter speed to control how much light the lens takes in.  My photography portfolio theme is nature and I decided to take photos outside and use the natural lightening on a day where the sun is out because it would create hard lighting and creating defined sharp edges and shadows making the images high contrast.  </p>

          <p> I wanted to use natural colours and textures of fruits and plants so three of my photos fill the frame, for example photo five of the peppers. In two other pictures I used the depth of filed to focus on one object while the others are blurred in the background, for example on photo one, the pink flower is in focus while the building is blurred in the background. I achieved this by squeezing the shutter speed until a green sqaure comes up on the object I want to focus on. </p>

          <h2 class="section-heading">Video Production basics:</h2>

          <p>Our group filmed in two locations, in the studio with artificial lighting and outside with natural lighting. In the studio we added a pink lighting and white balance as MOTDX has a pink theme.

We filmed a vox pox outside and used a wide shot to film our environment which was street art and by a canal and long shot to film our guest walking, we used these frames to make our video snappier and interesting.  </p>

          <p>We first set our camera on a tripod and made sure you could see the guests from a medium shot and the camera was angled correctly and not slanted. While filming outside we had to take risk assessment in consideration to keep ourselves safe from possible dangers like weather conditions and accidents that could possibly happen, we went out in a big group.

In this module I also learnt about three-point lighting- key light, fill light and back lights. The backlight is what will separate a person's figure from a background, the key light is the light that gives off the most illimitation and the fill light fills in shadows created by the key light</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize thereâ€™s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
