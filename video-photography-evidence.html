            <h2 class="section-heading">Photography basics:</h2>

          <p> I chose to take my photos on a DSL camera so I could have better control of the DOF and have a better image quality- and to also get experience taking photos on a camera instead of a mobile phone. During this module I have learnt how to use the aperture and shutter speed to control how much light the lens takes in.  My photography portfolio theme is nature and I decided to take photos outside and use the natural lightening on a day where the sun is out because it would create hard lighting and creating defined sharp edges and shadows making the images high contrast.  </p>

          <p> I wanted to use natural colours and textures of fruits and plants so three of my photos fill the frame, for example photo five of the peppers. In two other pictures I used the depth of filed to focus on one object while the others are blurred in the background, for example on photo one, the pink flower is in focus while the building is blurred in the background. I achieved this by squeezing the shutter speed until a green sqaure comes up on the object I want to focus on. </p>

          <p>For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>

          <p>There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>

          <p>Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>

          <p>Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.</p>

          <p>As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.</p>
